This directory holds some work-in-progress code for testing the
protocol translator.  The current test suite is nowhere near
comprehensive.

Each test must be individually run on a system with an a8r8g8b8
visual, GLOBAL_SCALE and OUTPUT_SCALE set to 1.  They also rely on
reference data; if some legitimate changes are made that affect test
results, then the tests should be run with TEST_WRITE_REFERENCE=1,
which will make the test binaries write out reference data to disk.

When tests are being run, the tester must be very careful to not
interfere with the test operation by moving or resizing the test
window.  A compositing manager should be running along with the test.

These tests are supposed to test the functionality of the protocol
translator by connecting to a running instance and validating the
results of various high-level requests.  In modern parlance, they
would be ``integration tests''.

Most likely, you do not want to run these tests manually, as the
`run_tests.sh' script does all the setup for you.
